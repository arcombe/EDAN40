attachHeads :: a -> a -> [([a],[a])] -> [([a],[a])]
attachHeads h1 h2 aList = [(h1:xs,h2:ys) | (xs,ys) <- aList]

The attachHeads function takes to 3 arguments 2 single objects and a list
of tuples with lists, all of the same types. It then putes the tuple one at a time in
(xs, ys) and sets h1 and h2 in the head of the lists in the tuples. Then returns
the new list with tuples containing lists that all have the head h1 and h2.

Example:
attachHeads "al" "ex" [(["hej"], ["då"]),(["hej"],["igen"])]
returns [(["alhej"], ["exdå"]),(["alhej"],["exigen"])]
